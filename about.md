For those who don't know me I'm a student and currently working on infosec, so i'm always still learning. Sometimes you'll see some basic stuff (most of time) sometimes you'll see some freak stuff, it depends.
I created this site to alert people for some issues in this world so they can protect themselves. Comments are allowed if they are constructive ones, everyone gains with that.
If you want you can follow me on twitter, usually I retweet articles that I found usefull for a day-to-day work in infosec.
